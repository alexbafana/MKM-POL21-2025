# üß™ AI Agent Examples

This folder contains **executable demonstration scenarios and simulation traces** showcasing how different types of AI agents operate within the MKM-POL21-2025 decentralized knowledge infrastructure. Each example illustrates an integrated workflow involving semantic asset monitoring, trust scoring, NLP enrichment, or governance participation driven by autonomous agents.

---

## üéØ Purpose

The examples in this folder are intended to:

- **Demonstrate real-world use cases** for each AI agent class (e.g., curator, trust scorer, governance delegate).
- Serve as **testbeds** for validating the correctness, coherence, and reliability of agent logic.
- Provide **tutorials and reference flows** for developers extending the MKM infrastructure.
- Facilitate **academic reproducibility** of design-science artifacts developed in the project.

Each example is accompanied by input data, execution scripts, expected outputs, and logging artifacts.

## üß† Example: RDF Trust Scoring

The `trust_scoring/` example simulates how an RDF metadata file is analyzed by the trust agent. Steps:

1. Load RDF from `input/err_segment_2025.ttl`
2. Evaluate based on:
   - Author's MFSSIA credential
   - Ontology alignment
   - Time of publication
   - Peer endorsements
3. Compute and log score to `output/trust_report.json`
4. Optionally publish annotated RDF to DKG

To run:

```bash
cd trust_scoring/
python3 run_scoring.py --rdf input/err_segment_2025.ttl
