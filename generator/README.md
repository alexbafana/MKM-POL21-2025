# 🔧 generator/

This folder contains the **DAO-ML to Solidity code generation engine**, a core component of the MKM-POL21-2025 project. Its purpose is to transform formal DAO-ML governance models—authored in XML—into executable, secure, and verifiable smart contracts that manage access, decision-making, and workflows over the blockchain-anchored Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The code generation engine automates the translation of governance logic from **declarative models** to **executable Ethereum-compatible smart contracts**, reducing manual errors and ensuring a traceable, model-driven development pipeline.

It enforces the principle that **DAO behavior must be grounded in verifiable governance models**—a foundational requirement for trust and legitimacy in public-sector Web3 systems.

---

## 🔗 Context in MKM-POL21-2025

The MKM project aims to create a transparent, traceable, and participatory semantic data infrastructure for the Estonian cultural and media sector. This generator enables:

- ✅ Model-driven deployment of DAO governance over media ontologies and RDF datasets.
- ✅ Enforcement of identity and access control rules via integration with MFSSIA challenge-response mechanisms.
- ✅ Lifecycle automation for DAO proposals, content curation tasks, and semantic asset publishing.

## 🧠 Functional Overview

### 🔄 Input:
- One or more **DAO-ML XML** files (from the `/model` directory).
- Each XML model defines roles, permissions, voting logic, and lifecycle hooks.

### ⚙️ Processing:
- XML parsing and schema validation (via XSD).
- XPath-based extraction of governance rules.
- Mapping of logical constructs to Solidity contract templates.
- Optional inlining of MFSSIA or token-based logic components.

### 📤 Output:
- One or more **Solidity (`.sol`) files**, each corresponding to:
  - A DAO controller contract
  - Role-bound modules
  - Voting and token logic
  - MFSSIA verification interface

## 🧱 Architecture

The generator is composed of the following components:

| File/Module                 | Description                                                       |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `parser.py`                 | XML parser and structure validator (based on XSD/XPath)           |
| `translator.py`             | Rule mapper: DAO-ML → Solidity construct                         |
| `template_engine.py`        | Fills Solidity contract stubs using parsed rule definitions       |
| `mfssia_injector.py`        | Inserts MFSSIA challenge verification into access control logic   |
| `tokenomics_module.py`      | Generates utility/governance token logic as specified in XML      |
| `output/`                   | Final Solidity files ready for deployment                        |

## ⚠️ Features In Progress

- 🔄 **Round-trip modeling**: re-ingest smart contracts for documentation and auditing.
- 🧪 **Simulation interface**: pre-deployment testing of governance processes using mock roles and events.
- 🔐 **Formal verification hooks**: pluggable support for SMT-based model checking or verification with Certora or Slither.
- 🔁 **Upgradeable contracts**: integration with UUPS proxies for long-term governance system maintenance.

---

## 🧩 Integration with MFSSIA & AI Agents

- The generator automatically attaches MFSSIA hooks to any role or permission node annotated with an `<mfssia:requirement>` tag.
- This ensures only identity-authenticated actors may call privileged functions in the smart contract.
- Future integration will allow smart agents (ElizaOS-compatible) to autonomously propose changes to governance parameters, which will be translated into proposals via generated contracts.

## 🗂 Example Use Cases

| DAO Scenario                          | Output Contracts                                      |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Media content curation DAO           | Role manager, quorum voting, stake-weighted minting  |
| Public data verification committee   | Challenge-gated access control, multi-sig execution  |
| Token economy with vote rewards      | ERC20 + proposal tracker + time-lock executor        |
