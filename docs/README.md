# 📚 docs/

This folder contains the **formal documentation, research artifacts, system specifications, and design diagrams** produced during the development of the MKM-POL21-2025 project. As the project follows a **Design Science Research (DSR)** methodology, this folder also captures the evolving knowledge base of the artifacts developed—spanning smart governance, decentralized knowledge graphs, AI agents, and semantic asset infrastructures.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The `docs/` folder serves to:

- **Document the design rationale** behind every major artifact: DAO-ML models, MFSSIA mechanisms, AI agent workflows, and DKG integration.
- Provide **formally structured specifications and diagrams** to guide implementation and stakeholder alignment.
- Capture **project deliverables** required by the Estonian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (MKM).
- Support **academic dissemination**, reproducibility, and auditability of the scientific contributions made.
